how to install docker and docker compose in wsl2 ubuntu and verify where docker and docker compose are working?
To install Docker and Docker Compose on WSL2 Ubuntu and verify that they are working, follow the steps below.

### Step 1: Update Your System
First, ensure your system is up-to-date by running:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

### Step 2: Install Docker
1. **Install Required Packages**
   Install necessary packages to allow `apt` to use packages over HTTPS:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
   ```

2. **Add Docker’s Official GPG Key**
   Add Docker’s official GPG key to your system:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
   ```

3. **Set Up the Docker Repository**
   Add Docker's repository to `apt` sources:
   ```bash
   echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
   ```

4. **Install Docker Engine**
   Update the package list again and install Docker:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
   ```

### Step 3: Install Docker Compose
Docker Compose is now distributed as a Docker plugin, so you need to install the Docker Compose plugin.

1. **Install Docker Compose Plugin**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install docker-compose-plugin
   ```

### Step 4: Add Your User to the Docker Group
By default, only the root user or users with `sudo` privileges can manage Docker. You can add your user to the `docker` group to avoid needing `sudo` for Docker commands:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
After running this command, **restart your terminal** or log out and back in.

### Step 5: Verify Docker and Docker Compose
To ensure Docker and Docker Compose are working correctly, run the following commands:

1. **Verify Docker Installation**:
   ```bash
   docker --version
   ```
   You should see something like:
   ```bash
   Docker version 20.xx.xx, build xx
   ```

2. **Verify Docker Compose Installation**:
   ```bash
   docker compose version
   ```
   You should see something like:
   ```bash
   Docker Compose version v2.x.x
   ```

### Step 6: Test Docker with a Hello World Container
To ensure Docker is properly running, run the `hello-world` container:
```bash
docker run hello-world
```
This command will download a test image and run it. If Docker is correctly installed, you will see a message that says, "Hello from Docker!"

### Additional Steps (if required):
If you encounter any issues with permissions or services not running, make sure the Docker service is up and running:
```bash
sudo service docker start
```

That's it! You've successfully installed Docker and Docker Compose on WSL2 Ubuntu. Let me know if you run into any issues!
