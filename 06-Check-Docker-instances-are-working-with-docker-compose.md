how to test if docker instance are running which are started using docker-compose

To test if Docker instances are running after being started with `docker-compose`, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Check Running Containers with Docker Compose

You can use the following command to see the status of the services started by Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

This will list all the containers started by your `docker-compose.yml` file, their names, states, and ports.

**Example Output:**
```bash
    Name                  Command               State               Ports
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
mongodb         docker-entrypoint.sh mongod      Up      0.0.0.0:27017->27017/tcp
mongo-express   tini -- /docker-entrypoint ...   Up      0.0.0.0:8081->8081/tcp
```
Here, both `mongodb` and `mongo-express` are running with their respective ports mapped.

### Step 2: Check Running Containers with Docker

Alternatively, you can use the regular Docker command to see all running containers:

```bash
docker ps
```

This will list all running containers, including those started by Docker Compose.

### Step 3: Test Container Functionality

1. **Test MongoDB Connectivity**:
   - If you want to ensure that MongoDB is running and accessible, use the MongoDB shell (`mongosh`) to connect to it. 
   Run this command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   mongosh "mongodb://root:example@localhost:27017"
   ```
   If the connection is successful, you are connected to the running MongoDB instance inside the Docker container.

2. **Test Mongo Express**:
   - Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8081`. If Mongo Express loads, the service is running as expected.

### Step 4: Logs and Container Health

To further verify that the services are running correctly, you can check the logs of the running containers using:

```bash
docker-compose logs
```

You can also view the logs for a specific container by appending the container name:

```bash
docker-compose logs mongodb
```

This will help you verify if there are any errors or warnings in the services.

### Step 5: Check the Status with Docker Inspect

To check the detailed status of a specific container, use `docker inspect`:

```bash
docker inspect <container_name>
```

This command provides deep insights into the containerâ€™s state, networking, and configurations.
