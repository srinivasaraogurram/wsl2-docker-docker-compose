To log in to WSL2, follow these steps:

### Option 1: Open WSL2 Directly from Start Menu
1. **Search for your installed Linux distribution** (e.g., "Ubuntu") in the **Start Menu** and click on it.
2. This will open a terminal window, logging you into the WSL2 instance of Ubuntu (or whichever distribution you've installed).

### Option 2: Using Command Prompt or PowerShell
1. **Open Command Prompt** or **PowerShell**.
2. Run the following command to start WSL:
   ```powershell
   wsl
   ```
   This will launch the default WSL distribution. If your default distribution is Ubuntu on WSL2, it will log you into that automatically.

   Alternatively, you can specify a distribution like so:
   ```powershell
   wsl -d Ubuntu
   ```
   If you have multiple distributions, you can specify the exact name of the distribution (e.g., `Ubuntu-20.04`).

### Option 3: Access as Root (Superuser)
If you want to log in as root, you can use:
```powershell
wsl -u root
```

This will log you in as the root user instead of your normal WSL user.

### Customizing Default User or Distribution
- To change your default WSL distribution, use:
  ```powershell
  wsl --set-default <DistributionName>
  ```
  For example:
  ```powershell
  wsl --set-default Ubuntu-20.04
  ```

- To change the default user for a specific distribution, you can run this inside your WSL2 terminal:
  ```bash
  sudo nano /etc/wsl.conf
  ```
  Add the following configuration:
  ```bash
  [user]
  default=<username>
  ```
